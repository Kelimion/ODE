# ODE: Odin Executable Toolkit

A set of utilities and libraries for manipulating PE and COFF files, implemented in [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin).
* dumper: An alternative to [objdump](https://linux.die.net/man/1/objdump) / [dumpbin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dumpbin-reference?view=msvc-160).
* linker: An alternative to [link.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/linker-options?view=msvc-160) / [lld.exe](https://lld.llvm.org/).

# Roadmap
## Initial
- [ ] PE file reading and display of information.
- [ ] COFF object file reading and display of information.
- [ ] Linking object files into an executable or library.

## Later
- [ ] Disassembler

## Maybe
- [ ] ELF and MachO file reading and display of information.
- [ ] Linking Linux and MacOS object files into an executable or library.
